	  	  RType Communication Protocol

1.	Introduction
	
1.1	Purpose
	This request for Comments provides informations about the
	communication protocol for developping the Rtype video
	game.You will find a description of the protocol
	and an explanation of its use.

1.2	Requierments
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	described in RFC 2119 [34].

	An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy
	one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the
	protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies
	all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level
	requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally
	compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST level requirements
	but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is
	said to be "conditionally compliant."

1.3	Terminology
	This specification uses a number of terms to refer to
	the roles played by participants in the RType communication.

	connection
		A transport layer virtual circuit established between two
		programs for the purpose of communication.
		
	message
		The basic unit of this communication protocol,
		consisting of a structure octets matching the syntax
		defined in section 4 and transmitted via the UDP
		protocol, client <-> server.

1.4	Overall Operation

	This protocol behavior is based on message, the client and the server
	can send and receive message on both side. see section 4 for the
	message list.

2.	Notation Convention and Generic Grammar
	Each message has an size of 512 octets
	
2.1	message
	Message are binary suit of octet that means all message MUST be
	serialised before being send. Message MUST be formated like this:
	OPCODE SPACE $ARG1 $ARG2
	ex: 0x01 playerid $touchN°1 $push&release

2.2	argument
	Arguments are OPTIONAL, some messages can have arg. see section 4
	for more informations about message.

3.	Serialisation
	This communication is a binary based protocol, all message and
	command sent MUST be serialised before communication,
	using the next stucture serialisation.

3.1	Structure serialisation
	{
		char		opcode;
		vector<string>	args
	}
	
4.	Message
4.1	move
	0x01 $playerId $x $y

4.2	attack
	0x02 $playerId $x $y

4.3	die
	0x03 $playerId

4.4	take bonus
	0x04 $playerId $bonus

4.5	connexion
	0x05 $data
